Sub OpenWorkbook()

'    the purpose of this macro is to allow the opening of a workbook when you do not know the
'    username of the person who will be opening it.

'    first, lets activate the book we are using.
Workbooks("PutYourWorkbookNameHere.xlsm").Activate
'    then activate a sheet (it doesn't matter which sheet we activate) just make sure that
'    whatever sheet you use does not have values in the ranges listed below (for this example we are using X1 and X2 on
'    the "Test" sheet.
Sheets("Test").Activate
'    Make sure these ranges ("X1") are not filled with data.
Range("X1").Value = Environ("Username")
'    Make sure these ranges ("X2") are not filled with data. The purpose of this X2 data is to specify more infomation that might
'    be attached to a username. For Example some organization have usernames as ("\Users\Billy\SAP\SAP GUI..."). While other users
'    might have their username say something like ("\Users\Billy.TestOrg\SAP\SAP GUI..."). We want the macro to open on either instance.
'    Your org might have only one username type, and if so, then this section won't matter.
